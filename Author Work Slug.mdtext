Title:  Author Work Slug

Timestamp: 20221008025603

Seq:    10.9.4

Level:  4 - Subsection

Class:  non-version

Body:

When the [[Author]] and associated fields are available for a Collection, then a special variable name of `author-work-slug` can be used in a [[Merge Template]] in order to obtain a nicely formatted line identifying the author, the type of work, the work title, and the date of the work, with links for author and work title. 

The slug will use whatever fields are available, skipping any fields that are missing, while still creating a nicely formatted line. 

The output will include HTML tags, but will not be enclosed in any paragraph or other block tags.
