Body:

This section is an attempt to spell out the intentions, values and principles that have influenced my development of the Notenik software application. 

Nothing here is meant to imply that the elements of this personal manifesto represent the *best* or *only* way to develop software; rather, this is just my attempt to explain the factors that have motivated me on this project.
