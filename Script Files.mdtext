Notenik supports script files that can be used for executing a series of commands to transform input data sources and templates into appropriate output. 

The file extension for a script file should be '.tcz', short for 'TDF Czar', which was a predecessor to PSTextMerge, which was in turn a predecessor to Notenik.
