<p><em>aka: aka</em></p>
<p>The word <code>AKA</code> can be used as both a label and a type. </p>
<p>&#8220;AKA&#8221; is a common abbreviation for the phrase &#8220;Also Known As,&#8221; and is used to introduce one or more alternative names. </p>
<p>A Collection should only have one field of type <code>AKA</code>. </p>
<p>This field type allows the user to assign one or more aliases for each Note in a Collection. Multiple alias values should have the individual values separated by commas, or by semicolons. </p>
<p><a href="wiki-style-links.html">Wiki Style Links</a> from other Notes may then refer to a Note through any of its <code>AKA</code> values, in addition to its title. </p>
<p>When editing, the <code>AKA</code> field will appear as a single line of editable text. </p>
