<p><strong>11.63 Version 2.4.0</strong></p>
<p>Released on 13 Dec 2019 </p>
<h5 id="added-startup-check">Added Startup Check</h5>
<p>Added a logic check to see if the app completed a successful launch the last time it was run. If not, then the application resets the user settings to avoid a recurring crash. </p>
<h5 id="added-note-to-note-linking">Added Note-to-Note Linking</h5>
<p>Wiki-style links between Notes within a Collection are now supported. Several related pieces of functionality work together to enable this capability. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Collection Settings pane now includes a checkbox for &#8220;Double Bracket Parsing for Inter-Note Links&#8221;. Turning this option on for a particular Collection allows the user to begin adding links between Notes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once this option is enabled, the body of a Note may include a link to another Note by enclosing the title of that other Note within double square brackets. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new Variable Modifier of &#8216;W&#8217; available in Merge Templates allows these inter-note pointers to be converted to usable links when generating HTML. </p>
</li>
</ul>
