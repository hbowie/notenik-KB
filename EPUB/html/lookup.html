<p><strong>7.10.5 Lookup</strong></p>
<p>The word <code>lookup</code> can be used as a field type, but is not intended to be used as a field label. </p>
<p>The intent of a lookup field is to allow one Collection to reference Notes stored in a second Collection. </p>
<p>The second Collection must have had a shortcut assigned to it, which you can do when you <a href="tailor-collection-settings.html">tailor Collection settings</a>. </p>
<p>Here is an example of how a lookup field might be specified in <a href="the-collection-template-file.html">the Collection template file</a>. </p>
<pre>
<code>Author: &lt;lookup: authors> 
</code></pre>
<p>The shortcut to the Collection to be referenced must be specified following the colon. In the example above, &#8216;authors&#8217; is the shortcut assigned to the second Collection. </p>
<p>One must be mindful of <a href="disk-access-permissions.html">Disk Access Permissions</a> when using a field with type <code>lookup</code>. This can probably best be handled by putting the second Collection alongside of the first, within the same parent folder. You can then use the <a href="open-parent-realm.html">Open Parent Realm</a> command to first open the parent, and then from there open the primary Collection (the one that does the referencing). </p>
<p>When viewing a <code>lookup</code> field on the Display tab, you will notice a couple of special features. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The value stored in the <code>lookup</code> field will be formatted as a link, using Notenik's own <a href="custom-url-scheme.html">Custom URL Scheme</a>. If that value already exists as a <code>Title</code> within the Collection identified by the referenced shortcut, then the link will be formatted to <code>open</code> the referenced Note within the second Collection; if the value does not yet exist within the second Collection, the the link will be formatted to <code>add</code> a Note titled with that value in the second Collection. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are additional non-blank fields found on the referenced Note in the second Collection, then the lookup value will appear following a disclosure triangle, and clicking on the triangle will disclose the additional available fields from the second Collection. </p>
</li>
</ul>
