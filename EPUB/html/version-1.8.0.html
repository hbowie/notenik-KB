<p><strong>11.69 Version 1.8.0</strong></p>
<p>Released on 06 Nov 2019 </p>
<h5 id="folder-open-thru-finder-drag-and-drop-enabled">Folder Open thru Finder Drag-and-Drop Enabled</h5>
<p>Folder(s) may now be opened by dragging them onto the Notenik icon in the Finder. Notenik will respond in one of four ways to each Finder item. </p>
<ul>
<li>If a folder contains an existing Notenik Collection, then that Collection will be opened in a new window. </li>
<li>If a folder is empty, then it will be initialized as a new Notenik Collection, and opened in a new window. </li>
<li>if the dragged item is not a folder at all, then an error message will be displayed. </li>
<li>Any other folder will be treated as a parent realm, and the resulting window will show Collections and Scripts found within that realm. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="changed-deployment-target-back-to-10.14-to-allow-operation-on-mojave">Changed Deployment Target Back to 10.14 to Allow Operation on Mojave</h5>
<p>The last release inadvertently made Notenik unavailable to Mojave users. </p>
<h5 id="reports-option-added-to-generate-sample-report-templates">Reports Option Added to Generate Sample Report Templates</h5>
<p>When the user pulls down the Reports Action menu from the Toolbar, the first two items they see will now be: </p>
<ul>
<li>Generate Report Sample in HTML </li>
<li>Generate Report Sample in Markdown </li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting one of these will then cause Notenik to create a reports folder for the collection, if one does not already exist, and then to create a report template containing all of the Collection's fields in a basic layout. The user may then modify this template in order to further customize the output formatting. </p>
