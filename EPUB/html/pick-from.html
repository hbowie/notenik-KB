<p><strong>7.10.6 Pick From</strong></p>
<p>This field type, when accompanied by a series of starting values, can be used to offer the user a drop-down menu allowing a choice from a set of previously used values, or the entry of a new value, which will then be added to the list. (Such a user interface widget is often referred to as a <em>combo box</em>.) </p>
<p>Here's an example of how you would do this in a Collection's template: </p>
<pre>
<code>Type: &lt;pick-from: static, post>
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, enter the usual field label, followed by a colon, and then follow that with the literal &#8216;pick-from: &#8217;, followed by the possible values, separated using commas or semicolons. </p>
