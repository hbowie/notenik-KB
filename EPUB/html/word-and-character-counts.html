<p><strong>6.2.16 Word and Character Counts</strong></p>
<p>Beneath the Note menu there is an option to Show Counts. If you are using the Notenik Markdown parser, then selecting this item will display a window showing five separate numbers pertaining to the Body field of the currently selected Note. </p>
<ul>
<li>Total Markdown Size &#8211; This is the total number of characters contained in the body field. </li>
<li>Number of Markdown Lines &#8211; The number of lines in the body field. A line is counted only when ended by a line break or by the end of the Body field. </li>
<li>Number of Words &#8211; The number of words contained in the Body field. </li>
<li>The number of text characters (excluding spaces and punctuation) contained in the Body field. </li>
<li>The average length of each word, calculated by dividing the Number of Text Characters by the Number of Words. </li>
</ul>
<p>Counts are only available if you are using the Notenik Markdown parser. </p>
<p>The Counts window will be refreshed each time you save your edits to a Note, or when a new Note is selected. </p>
<p>Only one Counts window is ever shown (no matter how many Collections you have open). </p>
