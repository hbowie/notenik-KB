<p><strong>11.12 Version 6.9.2</strong></p>
<p>Date: 13 Aug 2021</p>
<p>Released on August 13, 2021. </p>
<h5 id="corrected-two-markdown-parsing-bugs">Corrected Two Markdown Parsing Bugs</h5>
<p>Corrected a couple of bugs related to Markdown parsing. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The App Preference setting to select the desired Markdown parser was not working &#8211; Notenik's parser was always being used, no matter what the setting. This has been corrected to once again allow use of Down or Ink instead of Markdown's own parser. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hash characters (also called pound signs) were sometimes causing lines to be formatted as headings when they should not have been. A couple of changes were made to prevent this from happening. The first change was a straight-up bug fix. The second change was a matter of better <a href="heading-identification.html">heading identification</a>. If a line starts with a single hash mark, and is immediately followed by a character representing a digit (with no intervening space), then the hash mark will be treated as ordinary text, rather than the beginning of a heading line. </p>
</li>
</ul>
