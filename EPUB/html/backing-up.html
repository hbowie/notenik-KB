<p>Notenik is open-source software released under the terms of the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>. I mention this only to emphasize the point that, although I've done everything I can think of to enable Notenik to be used with existing folders full of text files, the software is provided &#8220;As Is&#8221;, without warranty of any kind. If you have problems, I'd like to know about them, so I can hopefully further improve the software. But you should be careful to back up your existing data before using it with Notenik (and during, of course).  <br />
