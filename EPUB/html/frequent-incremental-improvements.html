<p><strong>12.8 Frequent Incremental Improvements</strong></p>
<p>The Swift version of Notenik was already pretty useful when I released version 1.0 a couple of years ago. But I keep thinking of new features to add, and ways to make it better, or more useful, and I like to release improvements in small batches every couple of weeks. I think this sort of pace is more fun for me, and also more fun for users. Since the project is <a href="a-labor-of-love.html">a labor of love</a>, I don't need to save things up for a major new release in order to justify an upgrade fee every once in a while. </p>
