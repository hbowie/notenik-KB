<p><strong>4.1.7 Use of a Text Editor</strong></p>
<p>All of your Notenik files are plain text files that can be opened, viewed and edited with a text editor. <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> is one such product, and a basic version is available for free. </p>
<p>Notenik has a couple of menu commands that make it easy to open a file in your preferred text editor. </p>
<p>Use the <code>Text Edit Note</code> command under the <code>Note</code> menu to open the currently displayed Note in your default text editor. When you're done with your external edits, and have saved the file, use the <code>Reload Note</code> command to see the results of your external edits within Notenik. </p>
<p>Use the <code>Text Edit Collection's Template file</code> command beneath the Collection menu to open the Collection's template file in your preferred text editor. When you are done with your external edits, use the <code>Reload Collection</code> command to see the results of any changes made. </p>
