<p><strong>12.2 A Labor of Love</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy working on Notenik. I enjoy using it. I enjoy getting feedback from users, and it gives me a warm feeling to know that others are finding the software useful. I'm fortunate to be in a position that allows me to give back to others in some small way without needing renumeration. </p>
<p>Additionally, trying to optimize an app in order to maximize revenues and profits, in today's markets, are motivations that often seem to negatively influence an app's development trajectory, </p>
<p>And so Notenik is available for free, and the programming code is all open source and available on GitHub. </p>
