<p><strong>12.5 A Tool for Thinking</strong></p>
<p>As Steve Jobs famously said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A computer is &#8230; the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The written word is one of humankind's most powerful inventions, and a defining capability of our species. </p>
<p>Notenik is a tool for storing and organizing the written word. </p>
<p>Many apps today try to be &#8220;engaging&#8221;, by presenting you with words and sounds and  images that  will encourage you to react quickly, easily and frequently. </p>
<p>Notenik, on the other hand, doesn't try to entertain or influence you: it's just there to help you collect and organize ideas and information that you find meaningful. </p>
