<p><strong>7.9 Fields Useful for Reviews, Citations and Quotations</strong></p>
<p>You can specify an Author or an Artist field when using a Collection as some sort of catalog of works by others. For example, I have one Collection that I use to keep track of my favorite Quotations, and the Author field indicates the author of each quotation. I have another Collection where I maintain my thoughts about a series of albums, and use the Artist field to indicate the individual or group responsible for each album. </p>
<p>In either case, you can use Sort Option # 7 (under the Sort menu) to sort a Collection by Author or Artist. </p>
<p>When sorting by Author, the sort will be by first name first; if a Collection contains an Artist field, but no Author field, then the sort will be by Artist, and the word &#8216;the&#8217; will be ignored when found as the first work in the Artist's name. (In other words, &#8216;The Beatles&#8217; will be sorted under &#8216;B&#8217;, not under &#8216;T&#8217;.) </p>
<p>Following is the complete list of fields you may find useful when using Notenik to record quotes from, or commentary about, or citations of, authors and artists. </p>
