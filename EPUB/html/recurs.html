<p>7.7 <a href="task-related-fields.html">Task-Related Fields</a>&nbsp;&#8593;</p>
<p><strong>7.7.3 Recurs</strong></p>
<p>The word <code>recurs</code> can be used as both a label and a type. </p>
<p>In addition to <code>recurs</code> itself, this field type will be inferred for a label of <code>Every</code>. </p>
<p>A Collection should have at most one recurs field. </p>
<p>The recurs field is designed to work hand-in-hand with the first (or only) date field. </p>
<p>The recurs field is meant to imply that the associated task is meant to recur at some regular interval, and to supply the interval of recurrence, stated in plain English. </p>
<p>Unlike some other task-tracking systems, Notenik will not duplicate a task in order to increment its date according to the recurrence rule; the existing associated Note will simply have its date field incremented. </p>
<p>When editing, the recurs field will appear as a single line of editable text. </p>
<p>When displayed, the recurs field will appear as it was entered.   </p>
<p>Various user controls may be available to cause a Note's first or only date field to be incremented once, according to the stated recurs rule. </p>
<p>All of the following are valid expressions of a recurs rule. Note that use of the leading word <code>Every</code> is always optional, and is included only for readability. Case (upper or lower) is not significant. </p>
<ul>
<li>Daily </li>
<li>Every Weekday </li>
<li>Every 3 months </li>
<li>Every Tuesday </li>
<li>Every other Monday </li>
<li>Every month </li>
<li>Quarterly </li>
<li>Every Year </li>
<li>The 15th of every month </li>
<li>2nd Tuesday of every month </li>
</ul>
