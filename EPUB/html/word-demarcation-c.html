<p>8.3 <a href="variable-modifiers.html">Variable Modifiers</a>&nbsp;&#8593;</p>
<p><strong>8.3.9 Word Demarcation - C</strong></p>
<p>The letter &#8220;C&#8221; indicates that the variable consists of a series of words, and you wish to change or standardize the way in which the words are distinguished from one another. </p>
<p>When parsing the variable, the beginning of a new word will be indicated by either whitespace or punctuation between words, or by a transition from lowercase to uppercase (as in CamelCase usage). In other words, &#8220;two words&#8221;, &#8220;TWO_WORDS&#8221; or &#8220;twoWords&#8221; would all be parsed into two separate words. </p>
<p>What you want done with the word demarcation is defined by the characters following the &#8220;C&#8221; in the modifiers string. The letter &#8220;u&#8221; indicates a conversion to uppercase, the letter &#8220;l&#8221; indicates a conversion to lowercase, and the letter &#8220;a&#8221; indicates that the character should be left as-is. Anything other than these three characters (including a space) will be interpreted as a separator to be placed between the words. </p>
<p>Note that the u/l/a indicator can be specified three different times. </p>
<ol>
<li>The first appearance will control the case of the first letter in the entire variable; </li>
<li>The second appearance will control the case of the first letter of each word; </li>
<li>The third appearance will control the appearance of all other letters. </li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if the template file contained the following: </p>
<pre>
<code>=$name&amp;cuul$=
</code></pre>
<p>And the name variable was equal to: </p>
<pre>
<code>HERB BOWIE
</code></pre>
<p>Then the resulting name in the output text file would be: </p>
<pre>
<code>Herb Bowie
</code></pre>
