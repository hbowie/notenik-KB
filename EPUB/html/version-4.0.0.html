<p><strong>11.47 Version 4.0.0</strong></p>
<p>Released on 10 Jun 2020 </p>
<h5 id="added-import-option-for-xml">Added Import Option for XML</h5>
<p>At a minimum, this will allow former iWisdom users to import their old collections into Notenik. </p>
<h5 id="added-double-click-actions-to-the-tags-tab">Added Double-Click Actions to the Tags Tab</h5>
<p>Double-clicking on a row in the Tags tab will now cause one of two actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you're double-clicking on a tag, then double-clicking will expand or collapse it; </li>
<li>If you're double-clicking on a Note, then double-clicking will attempt to launch whatever is in the Link field for the Note, just as double-clicking does on the List tab. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="table-of-contents-generation-for-markdown">Table of Contents Generation for Markdown</h5>
<p>Adding a line containing only &#8216;[toc]&#8217; within the body field will now cause that line to be replaced by a table of contents containing links to all of the headings following the &#8216;[toc]&#8217; line. This will only happen if you have chosen to use the Notenik Markdown parser in the Notenik settings. </p>
<h5 id="additional-support-for-link-field-variants">Additional Support for Link field variants</h5>
<p>Any field whose label contains the word &#8216;link&#8217; will now be treated as a Link field, and will be shown as a clickable link on the Display tab. Additionally, if a Note does not have a simple &#8216;Link&#8217; field, then launching the Note's link, or double-clicking on the Note, will cause the first non-blank link field on the Note to be used. </p>
<h5 id="links-need-no-longer-start-with-https">Links need no longer start with https</h5>
<p>A Link may now be entered without any URL scheme, so long as the implicit scheme of &#8216;https://&#8217; will be sufficient to access the link. </p>
