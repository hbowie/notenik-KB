<p><strong>6.2.1 Heading Identification</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#header">John Gruber's description of Markdown syntax</a> leaves room for some ambiguity surrounding two questions concerning the use of one or more hash characters to indicate a heading: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Must a heading line be preceded by a blank line? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Must the string of hash characters be followed by a space, before beginning the text of the heading? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings">Markdown Guide</a> makes note of this ambiguity, and the resulting differences in interpretation among various Markdown parsers, but does not provide a definitive resolution for either question. (See  <em>Heading Best Practices</em>.) </p>
<p>Notenik's own parser answers the questions above in the following manner. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A blank line before a heading is recommended (for readability, if nothing else), but is not required. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A space after the last hash character is also recommended, but not required. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>However</em>, if there is no intervening space, and the first character following the only hash character is a digit, then the Notenik parser will assume that the author's intent was for the hash character to be read as &#8216;number&#8217;, rather than triggering a heading. </p>
<p>For example: </p>
<p>#7 is a good bet in the next race. </p>
<p>But&#8230; </p>
<h1 id="number-7-is-a-good-bet-in-the-next-race.">Number 7 is a good bet in the next race.</h1>
