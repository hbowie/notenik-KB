<p><strong>11.23 Version 6.3.0</strong></p>
<p>Date: 10 Jun 2021</p>
<p>Released on 09 Jun 2021 </p>
<h5 id="new-documentation-is-coming">New Documentation is Coming!</h5>
<p>I'm using the new Notenik features included in this release to develop a new Notenik Knowledge Base that will be available soon! </p>
<h5 id="added-new-collection-command-to-replace-tags-based-on-seq-and-level">Added New Collection Command to Replace Tags based on Seq and Level</h5>
<p>This new command automatically adds tags to reflect the outline structure created by combining Seq and Level. </p>
<h5 id="added-collection-command-to-renumber-seq-based-on-level">Added Collection Command to Renumber Seq Based on Level</h5>
<p>Now that we have a Level field, we can combine Level with Seq to create an outline structure, and then, with this change, can automatically renumber the Seq fields in a Collection to reflect that outline structure. </p>
<h5 id="added-level-as-new-field-label-and-type">Added Level as New Field Label and Type</h5>
<p><code>Level</code> has been added as a new field label and type. </p>
<h5 id="updates-to-work-list-field-type">Updates to Work List Field Type</h5>
<p>I added &#8216;Novel&#8217; and &#8216;Podcast&#8217; as new choices, when specifying the type of work being referenced or quoted. </p>
<p>I also modified the logic so that you can use either a leading lower-case letter, or leading upper-case, when entering a work type value. Whichever one is used, and chosen, the value stored will be with leading upper-case. </p>
