<p><strong>4.1.1 Note File Format</strong></p>
<p>The contents of each Notenik Note file are formatted in a way that is easy to read and write, for both humans and computers, but is somewhat special, and unique to Notenik. </p>
<p>Each Field in a Note consists of the Field's Label, followed by a colon and one or more spaces, followed by the Field's Value. </p>
<p>In other words, something like this: </p>
<pre>
<code>Title: This is a Sample Note
</code></pre>
<p>The Notenik approach to identifying fields within a Note is very similar to the <a href="http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/metadata.html">Multimarkdown metadata syntax</a>, and also similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>. </p>
<p>Here are the general formattng rules for Note files within Notenik: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Note consists of a series of Fields. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Field consists of an identifying label, followed by a value. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The label can be spelled out in typically human fashion, with capitalization and spacing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The label must be immediately followed by a colon, and the colon must be followed by one or more spaces. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most values are specified on the same line as the label, but multi-line values (for types such as longtext, teaser, code, body, etc.) can be specified on following lines. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One blank line should separate each Field (in other words, each label-value combination) from the beginning of the next Field. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Title Field must come first. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Body Field must be last. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the Body label is encountered, everything following will be interpreted as part of the Body's value. </p>
</li>
</ul>
