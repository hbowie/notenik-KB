<p>7.4 <a href="the-basic-set-of-fields.html">The Basic Set of Fields</a>&nbsp;&#8593;</p>
<p><strong>7.4.1 Title</strong></p>
<p>The word <code>title</code> can be used as both a label and a type. </p>
<p>A Collection must have one and only one field of type <code>title</code>, and it should be the <em>first</em> field within a Collection. </p>
<p>A Title consists of a few words telling you what the Note is about. </p>
<p>Each Note in a Collection must have a unique Title, however Notenik will automatically append a number, or increment one if already present, in order to allow a Note to be added that would otherwise be a duplicate. </p>
<p>When editing, the title field will appear as a single line of editable text. </p>
<p>When displayed, the title field will often be displayed in a bold and/or larger font, and often without being accompanied by its label.   </p>
<p>When used as a sort field, title values will be sorted by their lowest-common-denominator representation (ignoring case, spacing  and punctuation). </p>
<p>The title field for a Note serves as that Note's unique identifier within its Collection, in three different ways: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In its original form, as entered by the user, when presented to the user; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In its lowest common denominator form (as described above), when used internally by Notenik; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a lightly transformed form, when creating a file name for the Note, to be used on disk. </p>
</li>
</ol>
