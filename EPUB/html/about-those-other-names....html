<p><strong>13.2 About Those Other Names...</strong></p>
<p>Index: PowerSurge Publishing; iWisdom; PSTextMerge; Two Due; URL Union; </p>
<p>PowerSurge Publishing is registered in the US state of Washington as a Trade Name (sometimes known as a &#8220;DBA,&#8221; for &#8220;Doing Business As&#8221;) for <a href="https://hbowie.net/about.html">Herb Bowie</a>. </p>
<p>In the past I operated PowerSurgePub.com as its own website, where you could find a number of desktop apps I'd written in Java over a period of years, including the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Club Planner </li>
<li>HeadOut </li>
<li>iWisdom </li>
<li>Link Tweaker </li>
<li>Notenik (a version written in Java) </li>
<li>PSExplorer </li>
<li>PSRenamer </li>
<li>PSTextMerge </li>
<li>Tunes Checker </li>
<li>Two Due </li>
<li>URL Union </li>
</ul>
<p>In 2019 I switched from Java to Swift as my primary programming language. </p>
<p>The functionality of many of the Java programs listed above has been folded into the new Notenik, now written in Swift, and described in detail within this knowledge base. </p>
<p>At this point I am no longer maintaining any of the Java apps listed above, and am no longer maintaining PowerSurgePub.com as its own website. This URL should now redirect to Notenik.app. </p>
