<p><strong>3.4 Search</strong></p>
<p>Index: search; </p>
<p>The <code>Nav</code> menu offers several options for searching through the frontmost Collection. </p>
<p>The <code>Advanced Search</code> option will bring up a new window, in which you may enter the text you wish to search for, and then select from a number of common fields to indicate which of these fields should be included in the search. You will also have an option to perform a case-sensitive search, or to perform a case-insensitive one. </p>
<p>The default search options are to search (if present) the Title, AKA, Link, Tags, Author (aka Creator) and Body fields, and to ignore case (e.g., a search for &#8216;amazon&#8217; will match &#8216;Amazon&#8217;). </p>
<p>Hit the <code>OK</code> button to initiate the Search and select the first Note in the Collection matching the search criteria. </p>
<p>A simpler option is to use the <code>Find</code> command to place your cursor in the <code>Search</code> field at the top of the frontmost Collection window, then type the text you wish to search for, and press <code>Enter</code> to start the search. </p>
<p>No matter how you initiated the Search, you can use the <code>Find Again</code> command to look for the next matching Note in the Collection following the last one found. </p>
<p>Note that, after using the Advanced Search Option, the options selected will persist until changed, or until the end of the Notenik session, even if you later initiate a search using the simpler method of specifying a new text string in the Search field at the top of the window. </p>
<p>Each visible occurrence of the search text will be highlighted on the Display tab, for each matching Note. </p>
