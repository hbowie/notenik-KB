<p><strong>2.1.3 The Field Labels and Types for your Collection</strong></p>
<p>Index: Zettelkasten; commonplace book; </p>
<p>Each Collection can have its own combination of <a href="field-labels-and-types.html">Field Labels and Types</a>. The fields you choose will help to determine the particular functionality that may be available for your Collection. </p>
<p>Most commonly you might have the following sorts of Collections. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Basic Notes &#8211; Such a Collection might have only a Title, Tags and Body fields. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web Links &#8211; Add a Link field to the ones defined for Basic Notes, and you can collect your web bookmarks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To Do &#8211; Add a Date field, a Status field and a Recurs field, and you have a basic task list. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sequenced List &#8211; Add a Seq field and you can sort your list by whatever identifiers are meaningful to you. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> &#8211; Add a timestamp field to help prevent your wiki-stile links between Notes from breaking when you rename a Note. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blog &#8211; Add several other useful fields if you are interested in generating a blog from your Collection. </p>
</li>
