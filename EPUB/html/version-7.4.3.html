<p><strong>11.5 Version 7.4.3</strong></p>
<p>Date: 16 Oct 2021</p>
<p>Released on 17 Oct 2021 </p>
<h5 id="notes-without-titles-no-longer-disappear">Notes without titles no longer disappear</h5>
<p>I recently noticed that, if I tried to add a new Note, but neglected to enter any kind of title, the new Note would simply vanish without a trace. Now, if this happens, one of two things will occur: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the new Note has a body field, then the title will be taken from the start of that field; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the body field is also blank, then a default title of &#8220;New Note without a title&#8221; will be used. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="new-child-contextual-menu-item-is-no-longer-repeated">New Child Contextual Menu Item is no longer Repeated</h5>
<p>I recently noticed that, if I reloaded a Collection that was eligible for a <a href="assemble-an-outline.html">New Child</a> menu item on the List tab, then the <code>New Child</code> menu item would be repeated. This has now been fixed, so it should never appear more than once. </p>
<h5 id="aka-fields-now-immediately-available">AKA Fields Now Immediately Available</h5>
<p>When adding a new <a href="also-known-as.html">AKA</a> entry, the new identifier would not be available until the Collection was reloaded. New AKA identifiers should now be available as soon as the associated Note is saved. </p>
