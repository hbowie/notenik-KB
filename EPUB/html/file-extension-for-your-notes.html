<p><strong>2.1.4 File Extension for your Notes</strong></p>
<p>Index: file extensions; text editors; </p>
<p>The Notes within your Collection will be ordinary text files, but you can choose from a number of possible file extensions. </p>
<p>The choice of file extension will not affect the functionality of Notenik, but it may influence the choice of text editor made when and if you choose to edit a Note outside of Notenik. The file extension might also influence the formatting of your Note when opened in an external text editor. </p>
<p>The most common extension would be <code>.txt</code>, which would ordinarily cause your Notes to be opened as plain text files. </p>
<p>A common alternative would be <code>.md</code> to indicate a Markdown file, which might (depending on your particular Mac configuration) cause your Notes to be opened in some sort of specialized Markdown editor &#8211; or might cause your Notes to be formatted differently in your default text editor. </p>
<p>If none of this sounds meaningful to you, then simply let the extension default to <code>.txt</code>. </p>
