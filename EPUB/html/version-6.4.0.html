<p><strong>11.22 Version 6.4.0</strong></p>
<p>Date: 02 Jul 2021</p>
<p>Released on 02 July 2021 </p>
<h5 id="new-documentation">New Documentation</h5>
<p>Following the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), all Notenik information and documentation has been consolidated into a single Knowledge Base, accessible from the Help menu. The Knowledge Base is itself a Notenik Collection, and it takes advantage of a number of recently added features. </p>
<h5 id="level-navigation">Level Navigation</h5>
<p>When Notenik finds a Collection with both <a href="seq.html">Seq</a> and <a href="level.html">Level</a> fields, and when sorted by Seq + Title, and when Streamlined Reading is chosen, then additional navigation elements will be added to the Display tab. </p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of the Note's display there will appear a link to the parent of the current item. </li>
<li>At the bottom of the Note's display there will appear a link to the next Note in the list. </li>
<li>For parent Notes, there will also appear a list of the child Notes at the next level. </li>
</ul>
<h5 id="added-collection-setting-for-streamlined-reading">Added Collection Setting for Streamlined Reading</h5>
<p>As part of the Collection Settings, a user may now check a box to Format Display for Streamlined Reading. </p>
<p>Checking this option will cause the Display tab to focus on the Body of each Note, while minimizing the appearance of metadata. The net effect &#8211; especially if one declines to Include an Explicity Body Field Label on the Display tab &#8211; is to make it easier for a user to focus on the content of each Note. </p>
<h5 id="added-markdown-support-for-definition-lists">Added Markdown Support for Definition Lists</h5>
<p>Markdown definition lists are now supported by the standard Notenik parser. </p>
