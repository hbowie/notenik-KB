<p><strong>3.2 Add, Delete and Edit Your Notes</strong></p>
<p>The Edit tab lets you make changes to the Field Values of a Note. </p>
<p>Use the &#8216;+&#8217; (plus) sign on the Toolbar to clear the Field Values and prepare to Add a new Note. </p>
<p>Use the &#8216;-&#8217; (minus) sign on the Toolbar to delete the currently selected Note. </p>
<p>Click on the OK button on the Toolbar, or click on the Display tab, to complete and save your latest entries on the Edit tab. </p>
<p>The Note Menu also has equivalent commands, with keyboard shortcuts, to add a New Note or Delete a Note. </p>
<p>The Note Menu also contains a command to Discard Edits, which can help you easily do away with a new Note you had started to add, or any changes you had started to make to an existing Note. </p>
<p>You may alter the font size used on the Edit tab through use of the commands available to you under the View menu. </p>
