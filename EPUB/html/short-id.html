<p><strong>7.8.6 Short ID</strong></p>
<p>The phrase <code>Short ID</code> can be used as both a label and a type. </p>
<p>A Collection should only have one field of type <code>Short ID</code>. </p>
<p>A Short ID value is assigned automatically by Notenik, and is not user-editable. </p>
<p>The intent is to provide a string short enough to be easily shared, yet something that still provides a unique identifier for each Note in a Collection. </p>
<p>The Short ID is formed by taking the first one or two letters from the beginning of each word in the Note's <a href="title.html">Title</a> field. </p>
<p>Notenik's algorithm will try to form a Short ID between four and eight characters in length, but may create a longer value if that is necessary to achieve uniqueness. </p>
<p>One potential use of a Short ID field could be the generation of HTML pages that redirect readers to the original page, with the Short ID being used to form a file name for the redirecting pages, and with the full title being used to form the file names for the pages containing the actual intended content.  </p>
<p>Here is one such example: <a href="https://practopian.org/s/ckvcb.html">practopian.org/s/ckvcb.html</a>. </p>
