The Nav Board will also appear automatically if the user closes the last open Collection window. 

The Nav Board shows all easily accessible Collections in an outline, and also offers a series of buttons allowing the user to perform various actions. 

A combo box appears at the top left of the board. Type the first few letters of the name of a Collection's folder in order to bring it up, then hit enter/return to select it. 

The outline appears to the left of the window. Available Collections are available within three different groups.

Double-click on a Collection to open it, and dismiss the Nav Board.
