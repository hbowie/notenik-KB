Teaser: Script execution now runs asynchronously, so as not to block the main UI (no more spinning beach balls!); an animated indeterminate progress bar was added to the scripter window to let the user know that the script is still running; a browse command was also added to the scripting engine, so that the user can optionally open a local URL at the end of a script, both to let the user know the script is done, and also to allow the user to review the results (assuming the user was creating or updating a website or some collection of web pages).

Body:

Released on 19 May 2021
 
##### Browse Command added to Scripting Engine

The new Browse command can be placed at the end of a web generation script, and then set to open the `localhost` url pointing to the website just generated. 

 
##### Script Execution Now Runs Asynchronously

Script execution in the Scripter window now runs asynchronously, with an indeterminate progress bar animated to show that something is happening. No more spinning beach ball!
