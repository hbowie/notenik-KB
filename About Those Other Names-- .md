PowerSurge Publishing is registered in the US state of Washington as a Trade Name (sometimes known as a "DBA," for "Doing Business As") for [Herb Bowie](https://hbowie.net/about.html).

In the past I operated PowerSurgePub.com as its own website, where you could find a number of desktop apps I'd written in Java over a period of years, including the following:

* Club Planner
* HeadOut
* iWisdom
* Link Tweaker
* Notenik (a version written in Java)
* PSExplorer
* PSRenamer
* PSTextMerge
* Tunes Checker
* Two Due
* URL Union

In 2019 I switched from Java to Swift as my primary programming language. 

The functionality of many of the Java programs listed above has been folded into the new Notenik, now written in Swift, and described in detail within this knowledge base. 

At this point I am no longer maintaining any of the Java apps listed above, and am no longer maintaining PowerSurgePub.com as its own website. This URL should now redirect to Notenik.net.
