##### Add Parent Realm Info File to Restore Window Size and Location

When you close a [[parent realm]] window, Notenik will now save a file in the parent folder, with the name of `- INFO-parent-realm.nnk`. The file will contain the window size and location so that the next time that parent realm folder is opened, the window can be restored to its prior configuration.
