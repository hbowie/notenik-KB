Body:

When the [[Work RIghts]] and [[Work Rights Holder]] fields are specified for a Collection, then a special variable name of `work-rights-slug` can be used in a [[Merge Template]] in order to obtain a nicely formatted rights line -- typically, a copyright notice. 

In such a case, an accompanying [[Date]] field will be used as the initial publication date for the referenced work.
