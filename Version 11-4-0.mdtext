##### A Seq Field Can Now Be Used to Store a Time of Day

The logic for the [[Seq]] field has been modified to accommodate its use as a time of day. This can be handy when used in combination with a [[Date]] field. You can then sort a Collection by Date + Seq and see things sort into the expected sequence, and displayed as expected.
