Released on 29 Mar 2020
 
##### Modified Duplicate Handling

Changed the handling of duplicates so that Notenik will automatically add a numeric suffix, or increment one if already present, in order to allow a Note to be added that would otherwise be a duplicate. 

 
##### Fixed HTML Block parsing for Comments

Updated the new internal Markdown parser to recognize HTML comments. 

 
##### Fixed Blockquote Parsing Bug

When a blockquote was continued to a second paragraph, the second paragraph ended up being a blockquote within a blockquote. This has now been fixed.
