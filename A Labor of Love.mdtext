I enjoy working on Notenik. I enjoy using it. I enjoy getting feedback from users, and it gives me a warm feeling to know that others are finding the software useful. I'm fortunate to be in a position that allows me to give back to others in some small way without needing renumeration. 

And so Notenik is available for free, and the programming code is all open source and available on GitHub.
