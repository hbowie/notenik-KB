Body: 

The Notenik Markdown parser supports [double-bracket wiki-style links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink#Wikis) as an extension to the original Markdown spec from John Gruber. 

Simply enclose the name of another note within double brackets, like this -- `[[Overview]]` -- and a click on the resulting link will take you to that note.
