Notenik offers extensive support for [Markdown][md], John Gruber's text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. 

If you're new to Markdown, and would like to read about some of its advantages, feel free to consult my blog post titled [Why I Use Markdown (And Why You Should Too)](https://practopian.org/blog/hbowie/why-i-use-markdown-and-why-you-should-too.html).

Within Notenik the body of each Note can be formatted using Markdown, but so can any other field declared to be of the type `longtext`. 

Conversion to HTML will be done when displaying a Note, but can also be invoked when sharing a Note, or when generating HTML through Notenik's templating engine.
