##### Added Collection Pref for Streamlined Reading

As part of the Collection Preferences, a user may now check a box to Format Display for Streamlined Reading.

Checking this option will cause the Display tab to focus on the Body of each Note, while minimizing the appearance of metadata. The net effect -- especially if one declines to Include an Explicity Body Field Label on the Display tab -- is to make it easier for a user to focus on the content of each Note.
 
##### Added Markdown Support for Definition Lists

Markdown definition lists are now supported by the standard Notenik parser.
