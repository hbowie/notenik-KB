##### New Documentation is Coming!

I'm using the new Notenik features included in this release to develop a new Notenik Knowledge Base that will be available soon!

 
##### Added New Collection Command to Replace Tags based on Seq and Level

This new command automatically adds tags to reflect the outline structure created by combining Seq and Level. 

 
##### Added Collection Command to Renumber Seq Based on Level

Now that we have a Level field, we can combine Level with Seq to create an outline structure, and then, with this change, can automatically renumber the Seq fields in a Collection to reflect that outline structure. 

 
##### Added Level as New Field Label and Type

`Level` has been added as a new field label and type. 

 
##### Updates to Work List Field Type

I added 'Novel' and 'Podcast' as new choices, when specifying the type of work being referenced or quoted. 

I also modified the logic so that you can use either a leading lower-case letter, or leading upper-case, when entering a work type value. Whichever one is used, and chosen, the value stored will be with leading upper-case.
