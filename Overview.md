Notenik is a system for recording, storing, organizing, viewing and publishing Notes. 

Notenik is currently available as a Mac App. It can be downloaded from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12). There is no up-front cost, or any in-app purchases necessary, in order to download and use Notenik.

Each Note is stored in its own text file. 

A folder full of Notes is referred to as a Collection, and a user may have as many Collections as desired, and Collections may be stored in a variety of locations. 

One special feature of Notenik is the liberal and flexible use of Fields. In Notenik, a Note's Title and its Body are distinct fields. A Link field and a Tags field are available by default. Other field names, and field types, can be easily added. Each Collection can be tailored to have its own set of fields. 

Markdown is supported in the Body field, as well as in other `longtext` fields. 

Notenik also has its own templating language. You can create merge templates, using your preferred text editor, and can then merge the Notes and their Fields into one or more templates in order to create output text files -- most typically, HTML files. 

Notenik also has its own scripting language, You can record, modify, and/or write a script that will filter and sort one or more Collections and then merge the resulting data into one or more template files, to create a variety of output files. 

By creatively combining different fields, scripting parameters, and merge templates, Notenik can be used as a static site generator to create an entire website.
