Body:

This Markdown cheat sheet provides a quick overview of the basic Markdown syntax elements. In order to make this page as compact as possible, I've used commas to indicate places where line breaks would normally occur. 

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Heading | `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
| Bold    | `**bold text**`
| Italics | `*italicized text*`
| Blockquote | `> blockquote`
| Ordered List | `1. First item`, `2. Second item`
| Unordered List | \- First item, \- Second item
| Code    | \`code\`
| Horizontal Rule | \-\-\- |
| Link    | `[Notenik](https://notenik.app)`
| Image   | `![alt text](https://notenik.app/images/notenik-logo.png)`

For more information about any of these elements, refer to the [Daring Fireball site](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) for basic syntax, or to the sections above for extensions provided by the [[Notenik Markdown Parser]].

Thanks to [Matt Cone](https://www.mattcone.com/) for this cheat sheet I've adapted from his [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).
