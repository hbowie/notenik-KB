Level:  4 - Subsection

Body: 

The word `tags` can be used as both a label and a type. 

In addition to `tags` itself, this field type will be inferred for any of the following label values:

+ `keywords`
+ `category`
+ `categories`

A Collection should only have a single tags field. 

The tags field offers another way to organize the Notes within a Collection.
Tags may be used to group related notes into categories. One or more tags may be associated with each note, and each tag may contain one or more sub-tags. A period or a slash may be used to separate one level of a tag from the next level, with the period being preferred. A comma or a semi-colon may be used to separate one tag from another, with the comma being preferred.

When editing, the tags field will appear as a line of tokens, making it easier to pick from a list of tags that have already been created within the Collection. 

For display purposes, tags will often appear in italics, above the title field, and without any identifying label. 

Click on the Tags tab to see your Notes organized by tags, instead of appearing in a straight List. If a Note has multiple Tags assigned, then it will appear multiple times on the Tags tab, once for each Tag. By adding multiple levels to your Tags, you can effectively organize your Notes into an outline.

There is an option beneath the Sort menu to sort your list of Notes by Tags plus Title fields. 

Beneath the Collection menu you will find an option to perform a Tags Mass Change. The user will be prompted to specify *from* tags and *to* tags, and Notenik will then replace the from tags (in combination, if more than one is specified) with the to tags.
