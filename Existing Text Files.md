As I've noted in another article, Notenik uses its own unique [[Note File Format]]. However, since Notenik is rather late to the game of managing text files, and since those already using similar sorts of files are probably among those interested in my app, I wanted to talk a bit about how Notenik can be used with existing folders full of text files. 

First, philosophically, Notenik tries to follow [Postel's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle):

> Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. 

Unfortunately, it is not possible for Notenik to be endlessly liberal in this regard, and there are certainly loosely formatted text files that may not be interpreted by Notenik according to the author's wishes.
