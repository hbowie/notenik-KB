Notenik stores each Note as a separate text file, in the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) format, capable of being read and modified by any text editor, on almost any computer system in the world.

The file name is generally identical to the Note's title, with the exception of a few occasional tweaks to avoid running afoul of various common operating system limitations. 

Each Note consists of one or more fields. 

The Title field comes first, and specifies a unique name by which that Note shall be known. 

The Body field comes last, and specifies the primary textual content of the Note. The Body can be formatted using [[Markdown]]. 

Other fields may appear in between the Title and the Body.
