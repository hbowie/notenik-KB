The word `title` can be used as both a label and a type. 

A Collection must have one and only one field of type `title`, and it should be the *first* field within a Collection. 

A Title consists of a few words telling you what the Note is about. 

Each Note in a Collection must have a unique Title, however Notenik will automatically append a number, or increment one if already present, in order to allow a Note to be added that would otherwise be a duplicate. 

When editing, the title field will appear as a single line of editable text.

When displayed, the title field will often be displayed in a bold and/or larger font, and often without being accompanied by its label.   

When used as a sort field, title values will be sorted by their lowest-common-denominator representation (ignoring case, spacing  and punctuation). 

The title field for a Note serves as that Note's unique identifier within its Collection, in three different ways:

1. In its original form, as entered by the user, when presented to the user;

2. In its lowest common denominator form (as described above), when used internally by Notenik;

3. In a lightly transformed form, when creating a file name for the Note, to be used on disk.
