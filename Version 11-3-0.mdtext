##### Added macOS Shortcut Action to Open Quick Action Window

With this Notenik custom action, it is very easy to create a macOS Shortcut to invoke this action outside of Notenik, using whatever keyboard shortcut makes sense to you. In other words, this enables the user to create a global keyboard shortcut to open the Quick Action window in Notenik.
